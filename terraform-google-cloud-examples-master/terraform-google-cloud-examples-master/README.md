# Terraform examples on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

This repo contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code examples on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The Github repository
[https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-examples-aws](https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-examples-aws)
contains the code samples based in the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com). But those examples use AWS (Amazon Web Services).

Terraform also supports other Cloud providers and this Github repository contains the code samples of the book on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Quick start

You must have a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](http://cloud.google.com/) account.

The code consists of Terraform examples using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.

This is the list of examples:

* [01-hello-world](code/01-hello-world) - Terraform "Hello, World": Example of how to deploy a single server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the shortest script.
* [02-one-server](code/02-one-server) - Terraform One Server: Example of how deploy a single server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* [03-one-webserver](code/03-one-webserver) - Terraform Web Server: Example of how deploy a single web server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The web server returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/` listening on port 8080.
* [04-one-webserver-with-vars](code/04-one-webserver-with-vars) - Terraform Web Server with vars: Example of how deploy a single web server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The web server returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/` listening on port 8080, which is defined as a variable.
* [05-cluster-webserver](code/05-cluster-webserver) - Terraform Cluster Web Server: Example of how deploy a cluster of web servers on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Compute Engine and Auto Scaling, as well as a load balancer using Google Cloud Load Balancing. The cluster of web servers returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/`. The load balancer listens on port 80.
* [06-create-cloud-storage](code/06-create-cloud-storage) - Terraform Create Cloud Storage: Example of how deploy the creation of a Google Cloud Storage bucket on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* [07-terraform-state](code/07-terraform-state) - Terraform State: Example of how to store the information about what infrastructure has been created on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
